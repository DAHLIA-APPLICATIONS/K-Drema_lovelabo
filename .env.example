# K-Drama Love Labo Environment Variables

# This is an example file. Copy this to .env.local for local development.
# No environment variables are required for the MVP version as it runs entirely client-side.

# Future use (when database integration is added):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
